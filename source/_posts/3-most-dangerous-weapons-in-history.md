If you living in China, and if you can link with internet, you will see these 3 weapon which were born in Netizen's language. Orz, ofcourse, you need to know Chinese. The 3 most dangerous weapons are: 俯卧撑（push up）、打酱油(buying sauce)、躲猫猫(hide-and-seek)。

You know, China mainland is a place which fullfill fantasy and maricles. And the internet in China is the last free world of Chinese netizen. For many reasons, netizen in China have to creat some new words to conclude many things which are more and more absurd.

For example, the 3 most dangerous weapons in history.  And the first is ： 俯卧撑。 In [Wengan Case](http://virtualreview.org/china/zoom/634386/riot-in-wengan-county-guizhou-province), netizen pick 俯卧撑 from the official report which  power by Guizhou Police Department. As the report said, Li Shufen was killed by 俯卧撑( after she do 3 push up in the birgde, she die in the river ). From that on, 俯卧撑 was used in many ways. It just like a dangerous weapon.  netizen write it in their IM signture : the newest weapon:俯卧撑。And sometime, it was used like: Do Not doing 3 俯卧撑 in Midnight, or you will die abnormly.

The second weapon is:打酱油。It was born in the [Sex Photos Gate ](http://zonaeuropa.com/20080209_1.htm)which happen in Hongkong. It is a kiding word. when a citizen was interview about the photos in Guangzhou, he said, it is no concered of mine about the fucking sex photos. And from that on, many people used 打酱油 as comments in many post and news. It means, No Comments or I Can Not any about it.

What about [躲猫猫](http://www.google.com.hk/search?hl=zh-CN&amp;newwindow=1&amp;client=aff-cs-worldbrowser&amp;hs=lch&amp;q=%E8%BA%B2%E7%8C%AB%E7%8C%AB&amp;btnG=Google+%E6%90%9C%E7%B4%A2&amp;aq=f&amp;oq==f&amp;oq=)？Yeap, it is really a dangerous weapon. It was born in Yunnan Province. One man die in the police station, and he was injurned badly before he die. And the Great Fucking Police Station Claim, that guy die in the hide-and-seek game in Police station. So that 躲猫猫 became new dangerous weapon in China. When it was born, the media said, how  great the imagination is. People can die in Hide-and-Seek game,  and what things can not kill people?

These are 3 most dangerous weapon in the Chinese History, so , what's your comments?
