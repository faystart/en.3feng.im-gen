Hello, Bob? It's your father again. I have another quetion about my new computer. Can I tape a movie from cable TV then fax it from my VCR to my CD-ROM then e-mail it to my brother's celluar phone so he can make a copy on his neighbor's camcorder?

I want my husband to pay more attention to me. Got any perfume that smells like a computer?

You said I should spend more time with our children, so I turn their faces into icons.
