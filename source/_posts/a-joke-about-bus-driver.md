From my India friend:
> A little kid walks into a city bus and sits right behind the driver and starts yelling, &quot;If my dad was a bull and my mom a cow I'd be a little bull.&quot;
> 
> The driver starts getting mad at the noisy kid, who continues with, &quot;If my dad was an elephant and my mom a girl elephant I would be a little elephant.&quot;
> 
> The kid goes on with several animals until the bus driver gets angry and yells at the kid, &quot;What if your dad was gay and your mom was a prostitute?!&quot;
> 
> The kid smiles and says, &quot;I would be a bus driver!&quot;
