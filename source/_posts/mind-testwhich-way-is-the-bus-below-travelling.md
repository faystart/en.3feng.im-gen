Which way is the bus below travelling?
To the left or to the right?

Can't make up your mind?

Look carefully at the picture again.
Still don't know?

Primary school children all over the MUMBAI were shown this picture and asked the same question.
90% of them gave this answer: 'The bus is travelling to the right.'

When asked, 'Why do you think the bus is travelling to the right?'
They answered: 'Because you can't see the door to get on the bus.'
How do you feel now???
