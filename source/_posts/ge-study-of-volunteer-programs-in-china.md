 > Fortunately for us, there are firms like GE who not only have a passion for CSR, but also for measuring everything, and fortunately they were willing to share their most recent results.Results that will go a long way to show how through their programs they are effectively engaging their employees, developing long term programming, and building the internal branding of their firm. 

and the report:
 > One of the key reasons why GE is so successful in driving volunteerism, is simply because employees are the greatest supporters of this meaningful initiative.
