Chinese in UK, they want BBC tell the truth. They wore a white mask each other. And they standing in the Britain Capitol Building, it just means a protest which against BBC's wrong report on the Tibet issue in China.([Link](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://2008.163.com/08/0420/11/49VJ4C4C00742437.html&amp;langpair=zh|en&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;ie=UTF-8) Translate by Google language tool. when I search it in Google, no results match). 

The first photo was very interesting. I edited it by Photoshop, and Change BBC to CCAV( it is a trick of CCTV, anyway, it is another name of CCTV which given by Chinese netizen). I think it is also needed in China. But you will never see this scene in China. It is Forbidden.
