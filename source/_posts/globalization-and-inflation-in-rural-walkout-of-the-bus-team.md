Today, I call captain of the bus team if there is any bus to the township. The captain said, the fare of passenger paid could not afford the cost of fuel, and why we driving bus ?

As we know the inflation had occoured in China for months. But how about the globalization inflection? 3 years ago, the fare of the bus which from county to township is 5RMB, but after that, sometime the fuel price rising could affected the fare. For example, when the fuel price rise in the Mid-east, the fare will rising too, sometime will be 8RMB. At that time , the inflation of China was low level. Is the effection of Globalization?

And now, which's the effective? Inflation or Globalization ?
